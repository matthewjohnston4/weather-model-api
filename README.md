# The Weather Forecasting Model API

This is a simple GraphQL API that gives access to information about weather forecasting models, including their run times, their resolutions, etc. 

The API is presented using GraphQL and ApolloServer, and requires minimal setup.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (tested with version 10.9.0)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or you can try NPM and it'll probably work, but Yarn is what the project uses).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository. 
2. In the root of the repo, run `yarn`, which will install dependencies. 
3. Run `node index.js`

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, desired, and delightful - specifically where the model data in `data.js` is concerned.
